### The Survivors and Viticms on the Titanic
The Titanic was set to port along the east coast of New York, however, on April 15,1912, more then 1,500 people lost their lives [history](https://history.com/topics/titanic). Our objective was to investigate the survivors and vitcims who tragically lost their lives. 

We were given demographics and passenger information from **891** of the **2224** passangers and crew on board [Titanic Data](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/September/57e9a84c_titanic-data/titanic-data.csv). We wish to ask the question: *what factors made people more likely to survive?*
